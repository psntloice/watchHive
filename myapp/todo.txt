Ensure you make error handling manageable in crud of all

Make description nullable 

add fillable to the db attributes in the models
work on the controllers use where for update restrict from using find and also the correct responses in cases of success and failures

Front end add space for description and input a default value that can be seen by the user .also add a section to add picture


check that issue of refetching

handle putting the specific PATCH

do padding on the movies

how to handle that issue on update author since its picking idiff keys


handle errors of empty cases where either description or somethings is empty


deal with the alternatives

make favourites in db to be unique and may instead add strenght of the favourites


on favourites add the if for just incase its not working
