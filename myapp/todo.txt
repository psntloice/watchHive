Ensure you make error handling manageable in crud of all

Make description nullable 

add fillable to the db attributes in the models
work on the controllers use where for update restrict from using find and also the correct responses in cases of success and failures

Front end add space for description and input a default value that can be seen by the user .also add a section to add picture
